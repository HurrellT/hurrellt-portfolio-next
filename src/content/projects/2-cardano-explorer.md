Next generation blockchain explorer for Cardano, a decentralized public blockchain and cryptocurrency project. The explorer allowed users to search for transactions, addresses, and blocks on the Cardano blockchain. I was involved in the evolution of the, at the moment, current version of the explorer (know as 1.6.0). 
The explorer was built using React, TypeScript, and GraphQL. 
The link provided is a snapshot of the publicly available explorer at the time of my involvement. The newer version was undisclosed at that time.
