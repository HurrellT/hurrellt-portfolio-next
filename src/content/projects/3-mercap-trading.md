Mercap Trading is a Virtual Desk that consolidates financial planning and the management of Treasury, Securities, and Exchange Desk operations with electronic markets, integrating with the MAE, Rofex, and ByMA platforms. It also features a mobile app for inquiries and authorizations.

This solution automates the generation of short-term financial planning with great flexibility and ease of use. It aims to cover activities where time is a critical variable, simplify transaction entry, control operational risk, generate limit alerts, and provide real-time summarized information simultaneously.

Mercap Trading was designed to integrate efficiently into any production ecosystem, including ERP systems, Foreign Trade systems, Securities Back Office systems, and core banking systems, among others.
