Privacy Policy

Last updated: July 15, 2025

Thank you for using Chanchito.

Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your data. The short version: we donâ€™t collect any personal information â€” everything stays on your device.
1. No Data Collection

We do not collect, store, or share any personal data. The app operates entirely offline and does not send any information to external servers.
2. Local-Only Data Storage

All your data â€” including transactions, categories, and any other information â€” is stored locally on your device using a secure local database. You have full control over your data at all times.
3. No Internet Connection Required

Our app works completely offline. It does not require an internet connection to function, and it does not connect to any external services or APIs.
4. Your Control

You can view, edit, and delete all your data directly within the app. If you delete the app, your data is permanently removed from your device. We have no access to recover it.
5. Third-Party Services

We do not use third-party analytics tools, ad networks, or cloud storage. There are no hidden trackers or background data transmission.
6. Children's Privacy

Since we do not collect any data, the app is safe for users of all ages. However, we do not target children specifically or knowingly collect data from anyone.
7. Changes to This Policy

If we ever change the way the app handles data (for example, to add backup features), we will update this policy and clearly inform you before any data is collected or shared.
8. Contact Us
